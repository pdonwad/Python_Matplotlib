This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

Your objective is to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

Average Fare ($) Per City
Total Number of Rides Per City
Total Number of Drivers Per City
City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
In addition, you will be expected to produce the following three pie charts:

% of Total Fares by City Type
% of Total Rides by City Type
% of Total Drivers by City Type

As final considerations:

You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.- Done
You must use the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.-Done

You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, Wedge Percentages, and Wedge Labels.
Remember when making your plots to consider aesthetics!
You must stick to the Pyber color scheme (Gold, Light Sky Blue, and Light Coral) in producing your plot and pie charts.
When making your Bubble Plot, experiment with effects like alpha, edgecolor, and linewidths.
When making your Pie Chart, experiment with effects like shadow, startangle, and explosion.
You must include an exported markdown version of your Notebook called README.md in your GitHub repository.
